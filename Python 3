#Given testcase
#this is a simple code in Python to determine whether the given year is a leap year or not
We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years. The leap day is an extra, or intercalary day and we add it to the shortest month of the year, February.
In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.


def is_leap(year):
    if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return False
    if year % 4 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
year = int(input())

#Another approach without using any loops
def is_leap(year):
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0)
